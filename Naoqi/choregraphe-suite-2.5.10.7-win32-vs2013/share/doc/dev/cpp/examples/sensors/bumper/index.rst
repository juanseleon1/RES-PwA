Reacting to an event: bumper
============================

:ref:`\<\< return to C++ examples<cpp-examples>`

NAOqi framework allows event-based programming: it is possible to define a
callback function on an event. This callback function will be called each time
the event is raised.

In this section, we will demonstrate how to implement a callback function on a
simple event, raised when the right bumper is pressed.
